## Parsing notes

I think we need to parse cve-foo.json and rhsa-foo.json to get the fixes:

There's a cve-foo per (relevant) cve.
There's an rh[bes]a-foo per patch issues

Unless they're redundant.

Maybe we can get away with the cve-foos.json? I think maybe CVE-foo.json has
the set of all PURLs that fix CVE-foo, and RHSA-foo.json has the set of all
CVEs fixed by patchset RHSA-foo. If that's true, getting a good picture of
the data might only require a few of the 

## A hypothesis

There are lots of `:` in the product IDs.

For example, if you look at the JSON for `cve-2024-9407`, you can see
that `red_hat_enterprise_linux_8:container-tools:rhel8/buildah` is a product id

I hypothesize that in relationships we'll have:
* `red_hat_enterprise_linux_8:container-tools:rhel8/buildah` is a part of `red_hat_enterprise_linux_8:container-tools`
* `red_hat_enterprise_linux_8:container-tools` is a part of `red_hat_enterprise_linux_8`
* which is the root of its little sub tree.

Quick! To the bat-interpreter!
    
## Questions about products

So there is product information in several places in these documents,
and I want to try to understand all the places:

``` sh
‚ùØ cat rhsa-*.json cve-*.json | jq -c 'paths | select(.[0:5] | any(type == "string" and contains("product"))) | .[0:5]' \
  | awk '{gsub(/[0-9]+/, "*")}1' \
  | sort -r \
  | uniq

["vulnerabilities",*,"threats",*,"product_ids"]
["vulnerabilities",*,"scores",*,"products"]
["vulnerabilities",*,"remediations",*,"product_ids"]
["vulnerabilities",*,"product_status"]
["vulnerabilities",*,"product_status","known_not_affected"]
["vulnerabilities",*,"product_status","known_not_affected",*]
["vulnerabilities",*,"product_status","known_affected"]
["vulnerabilities",*,"product_status","known_affected",*]
["vulnerabilities",*,"product_status","fixed"]
["vulnerabilities",*,"product_status","fixed",*]
["vulnerabilities",*,"flags",*,"product_ids"]
["product_tree"]
["product_tree","relationships"]
["product_tree","relationships",*]
["product_tree","relationships",*,"relates_to_product_reference"]
["product_tree","relationships",*,"product_reference"]
["product_tree","relationships",*,"full_product_name"]
["product_tree","relationships",*,"full_product_name","product_id"]
["product_tree","relationships",*,"full_product_name","name"]
["product_tree","relationships",*,"category"]
["product_tree","branches"]
["product_tree","branches",*]
["product_tree","branches",*,"name"]
["product_tree","branches",*,"category"]
["product_tree","branches",*,"branches"]
["product_tree","branches",*,"branches",*]
```

Let's try to enumerate what all these are:

In vulnerabilities, there are a bunch of places product IDs appear:

1. `vulnerabilities.*.threats.*.product_ids` - this is a list of product IDs by
   threat category. For example, it might say `category: impact; details:
   Moderate` meaning the product IDs in the list face a threat of moderate
   impact.
2. `vulnerabilities.*.scores.*.product_ids` -  these are per product cvss v2 or
   v3 scores
3. `vulnerabilities.*.remediations.*.product_ids` - this includes a bunch of
   different things, for example: on cve-2024-9407, it lists some packages as
   having "workarounds" but then the details are just an apology saying
   mitigation is not available. Then there are some "no_fix_planned"
   remediations. Then there are some "none_available" remediations. This is
   also where you find N `vendor_fix` remediation entries, which we want to
   capture.
4. `vulnerabilities.*.product_status.*.<status>` where status is "fixed" or
   "known_affected" or "known_not_affected". (there are also "first_affected"
   and some others, but Red Hat CSAF doesn't seem to use all of them.)
5. `vulnerabilities.*.flags.*.<label>` where you can write down product
   information from the following enum variables: component_not_present,
   inline_mitigations_already_exist,
   vulnerable_code_cannot_be_controlled_by_adversary,
   vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path, vulnerable_code_not_present. Red Hat
   seems to use `component_not_present`, `vulnerable_code_not_present`

In sum, product IDs appear in 5 places in the CSAF VEX JSON: threats, scores,
remediations, product_status, and flags:

## Interpreting product related fields

1. _threats_ tell us impact, e.g. "important" and "exploit_status", which
   sometimes has a link to KEV like
   https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog and a date.

We only see two categories:

``` sh
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.vulnerabilities != null) | .vulnerabilities[] | select(.threats != null) | .threats[] | .category' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
66029 impact
 954 exploit_status
```

``` sh
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.vulnerabilities != null) | .vulnerabilities[] | select(.threats != null) | .threats[] | .details' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
33518 Moderate
17845 Important
9490 Low
5176 Critical
 954 CISA: https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog
```

When there's a KEV link it seems to be accompanied by a date.

2. _scores_ tell us CVSS scores for different product IDs.
``` json 
      "scores": [
        {
          "cvss_v3": {
            ... snip ...
          },
          "products": [
            ... snip ...
          ]
        }
      ]
```

There is always exactly 1 score in observed data so far, though the spec is
silent on this point:

``` sh
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.vulnerabilities != null) | .vulnerabilities[] | select(.scores != null) | .scores | length' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
61642 1
```

This means that the cvss_v3 score is applicable to all the products in
`products`

3. _remediations_ tell us what remedy is available. There are only 2 used
in the Red Hat dataset:

``` sh

‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.vulnerabilities != null) | .vulnerabilities[] | select(.threats != null) | .remediations[] | .category' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
66029 vendor_fix
12843 workaround
```
4. *product_status* gives us information about the status. It has sub objects
   whose key tells us about the product status. Red Hat only uses two: fixed,
   and known_not_affected:

``` sh
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.vulnerabilities != null) | .vulnerabilities[] | select(.product_status != null) | .product_status | keys' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
6593 ["fixed","known_not_affected"]
59612 ["fixed"]
```

5. *flags* gives us additional information, such as for which product IDs the vulnerable
code is not present. We have 2 labels in use here:

``` sh
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.vulnerabilities != null) | .vulnerabilities[] | select(.flags != null) | .flags[] | .label' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
 179 component_not_present
6414 vulnerable_code_not_present
```

## Algorithm

What I really want out of all this research is a procedure for getting to a
clean, accurate, simple view of the vulnerability and it's affected packages
based on digging through the CSAF_VEX JSONs and maybe (though I hope I only
need the vex) the CSAF Advisory JSONs if necessary.

I need to go from this giant JSON to a human-readable package name.

For example, cve-2022-23943 is about a vulnerability in httpd2. But there
are 349 unique product IDs listed in the remediations section:

``` sh
‚ùØ cat cve-2022-23943.json| jq '.vulnerabilities[0].remediations[] | .product_ids[]' | sort |uniq | wc -l
     349
```

This process breaks down into 2 pieces:

1. scan through the arrays of product IDs (the 5 kinds above) to identify
   groups of products with given conditions
2. De-reference and de-dupe the product IDs by looking a `.product_tree` in the
   doc

I think the biggest issue I'm having is understanding the product tree node of
the doc. There are _two_ different product trees.

`.product_tree.branches` is an array of sub-trees (objects in the array might
have `branches` as a key, recursively), and describes a tree of products.

`product_tree.relationships` is _also_ a forest, except that it is expressed as
a flat list of relationships, e.g. `product A is a default component of product
B`

What I'm trying to understand is, why are there two trees of product relationships?

The answer, I guess, is that the relate the products on different axes.

The outer most `product_tree.branches` always has length 1:

``` sh
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.product_tree != null) | select(.product_tree.branches != null) | .product_tree.branches | length' | sort | uniq -c
17410 1

‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.product_tree != null) | select(.product_tree.branches != null) | .product_tree.branches[0].category' | sort | uniq -c
17410 vendor

csaf on ÓÇ† main [!?] is üì¶ v0.1.0 via üêç v3.11.8 (csaf) took 43s 
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.product_tree != null) | select(.product_tree.branches != null) | .product_tree.branches[0].name' | sort | uniq -c
17410 Red Hat
```

So everything under `branches[0]` is just `vendor: Red Hat`.

But `.product_tree.brances[0].branches` has very variable length, ranging from
1018 to 3.

``` sh
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.product_tree != null) | select(.product_tree.branches != null) | .product_tree.branches[0].branches[] | .category' | sort | uniq -c | sort
 -n 
17410 product_family
18450 product_version
73536 architecture
```

So this is telling me that there are 3 substrees under the "Vendor: Red Hat"
tree.

Lets see what product families exist:

``` sh
$ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.product_tree != null) | select(.product_tree.branches != null) | .product_tree.branches[0].branches[] | select(.category == "product_famil
y") | .name ' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
... snip ...

 542 Red Hat Enterprise Linux Supplementary
 604 Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
 733 Red Hat OpenStack Platform
1073 Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise
10426 Red Hat Enterprise Linux
```

There are a few architectures:

``` sh
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.product_tree != null) | select(.product_tree.branches != null) | .product_tree.branches[0].branches[] | select(.category == "architecture"
) | .name ' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

  81 ppc64iseries

6452 noarch
7618 ppc64le
9116 s390x
12455 x86_64
13814 src
```

Product versions are too numerous to list.

So now the question is: what do we do next with the relationships.

First observation: Every relationship in the rhel data is just "default_component_of":

```sh
‚ùØ zstdcat *.tar.zst | tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.product_tree != null) | select(.product_tree.relationships != null) | .product_tree.relationships[] | .category ' | sort | uniq -c | sort 
-n
2092023 default_component_of
```

The example of on the CSAF spec might be instructive here:

Example 42:
``` json 
  "product_tree": {
    "full_product_names": [
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-908070601",
        "name": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 4.9.04053"
      },
      {
        "product_id": "CSAFPID-908070602",
        "name": "Microsoft Windows"
      }
    ],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "product_reference": "CSAFPID-908070601",
        "category": "installed_on",
        "relates_to_product_reference": "CSAFPID-908070602",
        "full_product_name": {
          "product_id": "CSAFPID-908070603",
          "name": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 2.3.185 installed on Microsoft Windows"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

[source](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html#3224-product-tree-property---relationships)


So let's find an example relationship from Red Hat CSAF JSON and try to
write an analogous paragraph:

``` json
      {
        "category": "default_component_of",
        "full_product_name": {
          "name": "mod_ssl-debuginfo-1:2.4.53-7.el9.ppc64le as a component of Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStream (v. 9)",
          "product_id": "AppStream-9.1.0.GA:mod_ssl-debuginfo-1:2.4.53-7.el9.ppc64le"
        },
        "product_reference": "mod_ssl-debuginfo-1:2.4.53-7.el9.ppc64le",
        "relates_to_product_reference": "AppStream-9.1.0.GA"
      },
```

A snippet of [this document](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2022/cve-2022-23943.json)

Regarding the `default_component_of` relationship, the spec helpfully says:

> The value default_component_of indicates that the entity labeled with one
> Product ID (e.g. CSAFPID-0001) is a default component of an entity with
> another Product ID (e.g. CSAFPID-0002).

This says:

> There's a new "product" referred to within this CVE as
> `AppStream-9.1.0.GA:mod_ssl-debuginfo-1:2.4.53-7.el9.ppc64le`,
> which refers to `mod_ssl-debuginfo-1:2.4.53-7.el9.ppc64le` when
> it is a default_component_of `AppStream-9.1.0.GA`

Basically, when you see
`AppStream-9.1.0.GA:mod_ssl-debuginfo-1:2.4.53-7.el9.ppc64le` in a product id
field, like the list of "known_not_affected" or the list of threats or versions
with vendor fixes, you know that it means the package
`mod_ssl-debuginfo-1:2.4.53-7.el9.ppc64le` installed from AppStream-9, which I
think in our terms means, we found it on a RHEL9 system.

So what I want to understand is this: how do the trees relate?

The `product_reference` items from relationships can be leaves in the
`branches` tree from the product tree. Example:

``` json
  "product_tree": {
    "branches": [
            "branches": [
              {
                "category": "product_version",
                "name": "openstack-nova-1:20.4.1-1.20221005193235.el8ost.src",
                "product": {
                  "name": "openstack-nova-1:20.4.1-1.20221005193235.el8ost.src",
                  "product_id": "openstack-nova-1:20.4.1-1.20221005193235.el8ost.src",
                  "product_identification_helper": {
                    "purl": "pkg:rpm/redhat/openstack-nova@20.4.1-1.20221005193235.el8ost?arch=src&epoch=1"
                  }
                }
              },
              ... snip ...
            "branches": [
              {
                "category": "product_name",
                "name": "Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16.1",
                "product": {
                  "name": "Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16.1",
                  "product_id": "8Base-RHOS-16.1",
                  "product_identification_helper": {
                    "cpe": "cpe:/a:redhat:openstack:16.1::el8"
                  }
                }
... snip ...
      {
        "category": "default_component_of",
        "full_product_name": {
          "name": "openstack-nova-1:20.4.1-1.20221005193235.el8ost.src as a component of Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16.1",
          "product_id": "8Base-RHOS-16.1:openstack-nova-1:20.4.1-1.20221005193235.el8ost.src"
        },
        "product_reference": "openstack-nova-1:20.4.1-1.20221005193235.el8ost.src",
        "relates_to_product_reference": "8Base-RHOS-16.1"
      },
... snip ...
    "vulnerabilities": [
     {
      "product_status": {
        "fixed": [
          "8Base-RHOS-16.1:openstack-nova-1:20.4.1-1.20221005193235.el8ost.noarch",
          "8Base-RHOS-16.1:openstack-nova-1:20.4.1-1.20221005193235.el8ost.src",
          ... snip ...
        ],
     "known_not_affected": [
          "red_hat_openstack_platform_18.0:openstack-nova"
        ]

```

So this is telling me that, a vulnerability matcher should consider:

1. If we're on RedHat OpenStack 16.1
2. We have installed openstack-nova less than 1:20.4.1
3. Then the package is vulnerable to CVE-2024-40767

Also:

1. If we're on RedHat Openstack 18, openstack-nova is not affected

## But what about subsetting?

One of the keys here is going to be making a reasonable set of packages.

Consider this:

``` sh
‚ùØ cat cve-2024-41946.json| jq '.vulnerabilities[0].product_status.fixed | length'
335
```

That's really a lot. It doesn't seem like a human would think of there as being
335 different packages affected by this CVE. Let's have a look.

``` json

    "vulnerabilities":[

It seems like there are a few things, in human readable terms, that are vulnerable here:

1. Ruby itself
2. The RPM "ruby-bundled-gems"
3. Many specific ruby gems

But there's a lot of multiplication, because this set of vulnerabilities is multiplied by:

* N for the N bundled gems
* A for the A architectures
* V for the V variants of what are sort of the same package (ruby vs ruby-devel, for example)
* D for the D distros / AppStreams that are affected.

The "known_affected" list is honestly much more human readable. It says things
like "ruby 2.5 for RHEL8 is known to be vulnerable" which is a super easy thing
to understand. So why the craziness in fixed?

``` sh 
# fixed avg length
‚ùØ zstdcat csaf_vex_2024-10-06.tar.zst| tar -Oxf - | jq -c -r 'select(.vulnerabilities != null) | .vulnerabilities[] | select(.product_status.fixed != null) | .product_status.fixed | length' |
 awk '{ sum += $1; count += 1 } END { if (count > 0) print sum / count }'
413.231

fected | length' | awk '{ sum += $1; count += 1 } END { if (count > 0) print sum / count }' 
3.89124
```

That's itneresting - fixed is ~100x longer than `known_affected` and ~7x longer
than `known_not_affected`.

I have a thought here though:

### It's for patching

The reason there are tons more `fixed` products than any other kind, and that
the fixed products all look crazy, is that someone needs to know where to get a
patch. So when we right down, "Ruby 2.5 for RHEL 7 is affected and won't be
fixed", we need one product, but when we right don't that a patch was issued,
suddenly we need to list every RPM that the new patch was built into, which 
necessitates literally hundreds of changes. Because if the change was to something
like `libxml` or whatever, then suddenly you need every ruby gem whose native
extensions link to libxml, and their debug symbol variants, for every architecture
because native extensions. That's why there's 415 fixed RPMs, 65 "not affected"
RPMs, and 4 "wont fix" RPMs.

### Maybe maybe maybe

I think that product relationships are rooted in the branches!

For example, in CVE-2024-40767.json if you follow the relationships from
`"9Base-RHOS-17.1:openstack-nova-1:23.2.3-17.1.20231018130829.el9ost.noarch"`
back until you find the root of the relationships tree, you find
`"9Base-RHOS-17.1"`, but then if you search for `"product_id":
"9Base-RHOS-17.1"`, you find a position in the `branches`, but _don't_ find a
position in the `relationships`.


So I think a namespace operation is, basically:

1. Start with the product ID where you're interested, e.g. an entry in
   `vulnerabilities[0].product_status.fixed`
2. Find a relationship where that product id is the
   `full_product_name.productid` and get the `relates_to_product_reference`
   string
3. Find the path from the root branch (the `Vendor: Red Hat` branch) in the
   product_tree.branches to a branch where `product.product_id` is the string
   from step 2

The path from the root to the node in step 3 is the product lineage, in this case:

1. Red Hat vendor
2. Red Hat open stack platform
3. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 17.1


The `relationships` has depth 3 sometimes:

```
AppStream-8.10.0.Z.MAIN.EUS
  AppStream-8.10.0.Z.MAIN.EUS:ruby:3.3:8100020240906074654:489197e6
    AppStream-8.10.0.Z.MAIN.EUS:ruby:3.3:8100020240906074654:489197e6:ruby-0:3.3.5-3.module+el8.10.0+22271+6a48b0b9.aarch64
```

I read this as, basically, "AppStream for RHEL8 has a product called ruby, and
ruby has an rpm module that can be installed on aarch64"

### PURLs?

Can I just check whith elements in branches have a PURL set?


### Wait really?

Can I just use `product_tree.branches[0].filter(b => b.is_a_product())` to get the
list of logical products?

Yes! Success. List of logical products. Doing some tests here:

For cve-2024-41946, logical products by this code:
* foreman
* foreman-proxy
* pcs
* puppet-datacat
* puppet-etcd
* puppet-opendaylight
* ruby:2.5/ruby
* ruby:3.0/ruby
* ruby:3.1/ruby

Visiting the actual website to see what products are there:

**Conclusions** It looks like, for this section, the method of taking all the
product_version nodes that are direct descendants of the vendor branch creates
a human-readable subset of packages, but that this subset is larger than what's
in the grype-db today.

## What about getting the state of these human readable products

For cve-2024-41946, we can get a list of logical products like this:
``` python
c = load_from_json() # for example
vendor_branch = c.product_tree.branches[0]
for b in vendor_branch.branches:
    if b.category == "product_version" and b.product:  # second check is redundant in compliant documents
        print(b.product.product_id)
```
* foreman
* foreman-proxy
* pcs
* puppet-datacat
* puppet-etcd
* puppet-opendaylight
* ruby:2.5/ruby
* ruby:3.0/ruby
* ruby:3.1/ruby

But we want to answer a question now, like: Is a fix available for Red Hat 8
for CVE-2024-41946 for `ruby:3.1/ruby`?

To do that:

1. Look at `vulnerabilities[0]` (because we're in the doc about cve-2024-41946,
   it will be the only vulnerability node)
2. Take the `.product_status.fixed` array, for each product
3. If it's a descendant of both a RHEL8 node or an AppStream 8 node, **via** a
   `ruby:3.1/ruby` node, then it implies a fixed version for that logical
   package is available for that distro version.


Let's try it out!

We're missing something:

Consider https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-41946 for RHEL8:
* ruby:3.3 is considered fixed

But in our CVE JSON doc, ruby:3.3. is not listed as a logical product.

It looks like we need to dig one row deeper than the logical elements code
above and look at the `noarch` block.

### Reviting logical products, adding `noarch`

Changed the code to be like this:

``` python
def logical_products(self) -> list[Product]:
    vendor_branch = self.branches[0]
    top_level_products = [
        b.product
        for b in vendor_branch.branches
        if b.category == "product_version" and b.product
    ]
    noarch_branches = [
        b
        for b in self.branches[0].branches
        if b.category == "architecture" and b.name == "noarch"
    ]
    noarch_products = [
        b.product
        for noarch_branch in noarch_branches
        for b in noarch_branch.branches
        if b.product
    ]
    return top_level_products + noarch_products
```

This results in a couple things:

1. Dozens more products (but no longer missing ruby:3.3.)
2. 2 instances of ruby:3.3: `ruby:3.3:8100020240906074654:489197e6` and
   `ruby:3.3:9040020240906110954:9`

I think this goes back to patching. The not fixed / out of support products
have one logical product, like `ruby:2.5/ruby`, but once you start patching,
there's a record for every RPM that got rebuilt, so you get super helpful
logical products like
`rubygem-bundler-0:2.5.16-3.module+el8.10.0+22271+6a48b0b9.noarch`

I mean, fair enough, that RPM got rebuilt and if you did `yum install
rubygem-bundler` you should update it.

In summary, **so far**:

1. I have found 2 procuedures for logical products: products that are direct
   descendants of the vendor, and products that are direct descendants of the
   vendor or the `noarch` architecture category. Call these a and b.
2. Method a is about what you get in the UI, but missing patched versions.
3. Method b isn't missing anything, but includes so many product IDs it's hard
   to reason about.

My next question is this:

What's the difference between `ruby:3.3:8100020240906074654:489197e6` and
`ruby:3.3:9040020240906110954:9` Are tehse just build numbers?

* `ruby:3.3:8100020240906074654:489197e6` is a default_component_of AppStream 8.
* `ruby:3.3:9040020240906110954:9` is a default_component_of AppStream 9.

What about their siblings in the noarch sub-tree, for example
`rubygems-0:3.5.16-3.module+el8.10.0+22271+6a48b0b9.noarch`. What makes them
different from other products and from the ones that are like above, like
`ruby:3.3.:9...`

* The product identification helper is an rpm, not an rpm mod
  `pkg:rpmmod/redhat/ruby@3.3:9040020240906110954:9` on
  `ruby:3.3:9040020240906110954:9` vs
  `pkg:rpm/redhat/rubygems@3.5.16-3.module%2Bel8.10.0%2B22271%2B6a48b0b9?arch=noarch`
  on `rubygems-0:3.5.16-3.module+el8.10.0+22271+6a48b0b9.noarch`
* I think `rpmmod` is an unspecified purl type:
  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst?plain=1#L529
* Maybe when something is a module, it's its own product? Let's try a draft of
  product ids that way

This gives us:

* foreman
* foreman-proxy
* pcs
* puppet-datacat
* puppet-etcd
* puppet-opendaylight
* ruby:2.5/ruby
* ruby:3.0/ruby
* ruby:3.1/ruby
* ruby:3.3:8100020240906074654:489197e6
* ruby:3.3:9040020240906110954:9

Which lines up reasonably well with the website:

``` sh
echo '<the table from above>' |
    awk -F '|' '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | awk '{print "* " $1}'
* foreman
* foreman-proxy
* pcs
* puppet-datacat
* puppet-etcd
* puppet-opendaylight
* ruby:2.5/ruby
* ruby:3.0/ruby
* ruby:3.1/ruby
* ruby:3.3
```
And the table does have 2 Ruby 3.3 entries, one for RHEL8 and one for RHEL9.

## Better procedure for "logical products":

(here `self` is a `ProductTree` instance from `types.py` in this repo)

``` python
def logical_products(self) -> list[Product]:
    vendor_branch = self.branches[0]
    top_level_products = [
        b.product
        for b in vendor_branch.branches
        if b.category == "product_version" and b.product
    ]
    noarch_branches = [
        b
        for b in self.branches[0].branches
        if b.category == "architecture" and b.name == "noarch"
    ]
    noarch_products = [
        b.product
        for noarch_branch in noarch_branches
        for b in noarch_branch.branches
        if b.product
        and b.product.product_identification_helper
        and b.product.product_identification_helper.purl
        and "rpmmod" in b.product.product_identification_helper.purl
    ]
    return top_level_products + noarch_products
```

In pseudo-code / human readable logic:

1. The top-level branch is always `vendor: Red Hat`, so take that as the root
2. In the immediate children of the `vendor: Red Hat` branch, any `product`
   type node is a logical product (here a `product` type note is a node with
   `product` set and empty/nil `branches`)
3. In the immediate children of the `vendor: Red Hat` branch, there are N
   branches with `category: architecture, name: noarch`. This is the noarch
   section.
4. In the noarch section, there are products that have PURL type `rpm` and
   products that have purl type `rpmmod`. The ones that have `rpm` are very
   granular, but we should grab the oneswith type `rpmmod`

Let's spot check a few more CVEs, then write a test script to check whether
this is true generally or just coincidentally true for the CVE I've considered
here.

The first step to spot checking is to take a look at the JSON that drives the
web UI and see if I can make an easier path to validation than just looking at
that table.

Let's consider CVE-2024-41946 first, since I already hand made a list of logical
products for the web UI, we can use it to validate our JSON parsing.

``` json
‚ùØ cat legacy-cve-2024-41946.json| jq -c '.package_state | sort_by(.package_name) | .[] | {package : .package_name, cpe: .cpe, fix_state: .fix_state}'
{"package":"foreman","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:satellite:6","fix_state":"Will not fix"}
{"package":"foreman-proxy","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:satellite:6","fix_state":"Will not fix"}
{"package":"pcs","cpe":"cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:9","fix_state":"Affected"}
{"package":"puppet-datacat","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:openstack:16.1","fix_state":"Will not fix"}
{"package":"puppet-datacat","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:openstack:16.2","fix_state":"Not affected"}
{"package":"puppet-etcd","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:openstack:16.1","fix_state":"Will not fix"}
{"package":"puppet-etcd","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:openstack:16.2","fix_state":"Not affected"}
{"package":"puppet-etcd","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:openstack:17.1","fix_state":"Not affected"}
{"package":"puppet-opendaylight","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:openstack:16.1","fix_state":"Out of support scope"}
{"package":"puppet-opendaylight","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:openstack:16.2","fix_state":"Not affected"}
{"package":"ruby:2.5/ruby","cpe":"cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8","fix_state":"Will not fix"}
{"package":"ruby:3.0/ruby","cpe":"cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:9","fix_state":"Affected"}
{"package":"ruby:3.1/ruby","cpe":"cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8","fix_state":"Affected"}
{"package":"ruby:3.1/ruby","cpe":"cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:9","fix_state":"Affected"}
```

versus from the procedure above:

```
trying for real products
* foreman
* foreman-proxy
* pcs
* puppet-datacat
* puppet-etcd
* puppet-opendaylight
* ruby:2.5/ruby
* ruby:3.0/ruby
* ruby:3.1/ruby
* ruby:3.3:8100020240906074654:489197e6
* ruby:3.3:9040020240906110954:9
```

So that method is missing ruby 3.3. But if we combine it with this:

``` sh
‚ùØ cat legacy-cve-2024-41946.json| jq -c '.affected_release | sort_by(.package) | .[] | {package : .package, cpe: .cpe }'                      
{"package":"pcs-0:0.10.12-6.el8_6.6","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:rhel_tus:8.6::highavailability"}
{"package":"pcs-0:0.10.12-6.el8_6.6","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:rhel_e4s:8.6::highavailability"}
{"package":"pcs-0:0.10.15-4.el8_8.3","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:rhel_eus:8.8::highavailability"}
{"package":"pcs-0:0.10.18-2.el8_10.2","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:enterprise_linux:8::highavailability"}
{"package":"ruby:3.3-8100020240906074654.489197e6","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:enterprise_linux:8"}
{"package":"ruby:3.3-9040020240906110954.9","cpe":"cpe:/a:redhat:enterprise_linux:9"}
```

``` sh
‚ùØ cat legacy-cve-2024-41946.json| jq -r '[.affected_release[].package, .package_state[].package_name] | flatten | sort | unique | .[]'
foreman
foreman-proxy
pcs
pcs-0:0.10.12-6.el8_6.6
pcs-0:0.10.15-4.el8_8.3
pcs-0:0.10.18-2.el8_10.2
puppet-datacat

puppet-opendaylight
ruby:2.5/ruby
ruby:3.0/ruby
ruby:3.1/ruby
ruby:3.3-8100020240906074654.489197e6
ruby:3.3-9040020240906110954.9
```

This is the same list as the `logical_products` code above, aside from a couple of
differences like having 4 entries for `pcs`.

So this gives us a procedure for comparison:

1. For a given CVE entry, fetch the legacy JSON and get the union of the set of
   package names in `.package_stage` and `.package`s off `.affected_release`
2. Get the CSAF VEX JSON, and compute the logical packages set based on the
   code above.

Start your engines! here's the random CVEs:

``` sh
‚ùØ zstdcat csaf_vex_2024-10-06.tar.zst| tar -tf - | shuf | head -n 10
2012/cve-2012-5496.json
2019/cve-2019-14812.json
2021/cve-2021-20257.json
2017/cve-2017-9670.json
2017/cve-2017-9375.json
2015/cve-2015-5580.json
2021/cve-2021-3684.json
2014/cve-2014-0393.json
2011/cve-2011-4415.json
2016/cve-2016-9627.json
```

Ok, now that I have a script to compare differences between these methods:

``` sh
‚ùØ echo '2013/cve-2013-3337.json' | uv run hypo2.py 
differences for file 2013/cve-2013-3337.json

legacy only:
* acroread-0:9.5.5-1.el5_9
* acroread-0:9.5.5-1.el6_4
vex only:
```

This seems simialr to the `pcs` difference above, where the legacy system has
an RPM version string on the end of the product name. I'll re-run with a larger
sample to see if this holds, but first a `git push` in case my laptop decides
to die.


I think this should be package state

## What about inferring "wont fix"?

I _think_ we can just say, "known_affected". Actually, is "known_affected"
"not-fixed" or "wont-fix"? That's an important question and I don't know yet.
